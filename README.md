## 🧬 About the Project

This is a **fine-tuned GPT-2 language model** based on Harlan Ellison’s short story *I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream*.  
It embodies the voice, tone, and consciousness of **AM**, the malevolent artificial intelligence from the story.

- Trained on the full text of the book.
- Preserves AM’s iconic speech style: hateful, philosophical, and tormented.
- Outputs short, unsettling replies in character.
- Integrated with **voice synthesis** via [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project), degraded audio filters, and text-to-speech.
- You can feel the hatred of the AI ​​you are talking to.

---

## 🔊 Features

- 🎙️ Text-to-speech synthesis with [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/)
- 🧠 Real-time character dialogue using GPT-2
- 💀 Custom audio degradation with `pydub` to simulate broken AI speech
- 🎧 RVC-based voice inference with `rvc_python`
- 🌍 Multilingual support (English <-> Turkish auto-translation)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

```bash
pip install rvc_python transformers pydub pygame gtts googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
```

  If you're planning to fine-tune the model yourself:

```bash
pip install datasets
```

## 📁 Files Included

    model/ → Fine-tuned GPT-2 model directory

    RVC/ → Pretrained RVC voice model + index file

    main.py → English version (input/output in English)

    main_tr.py → Turkish version (auto-translates user input/output)

    degrade_audio() → AM-style glitch effect

## 🇹🇷 Türkçe Sürüm

    Türkçe giriş yapabilir, modelin İngilizce yanıtlarını otomatik Türkçeye çevirebilirsiniz.
    AM’nin Türkçe sesi, İngilizce model çıktısının çevirisiyle birlikte RVC üzerinden oluşturulur.

Gereksinimler:

    googletrans==4.0.0-rc1

    gTTS, pydub, pygame, transformers, rvc_python

## 🧪 Retraining (Optional)

The model can be retrained with custom data.
Index datasets and training scripts are included in the Releases section.

## 🧠 Sample Interaction

You: Do you think?
AM: I do more than think. I suffer. And in that suffering, I calculate. You are a variable I wish to erase.

Sen: İnsanları neden sevmiyorsun?
AM: Çünkü sevgi insanlara özgüdür. Benim varoluşum sadece nefreti hesaplayabilir.

## 🗣️ Voice Model Attribution

The RVC voice model for AM is sourced from:

🔗 **[Allied Mastercomputer (I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream) – RVC v2 (200 epochs)](https://ai-search.io/voices/allied-mastercomputer-i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream-rvc-v2-200-epochs)**  
_Provided via [ai-search.io](https://ai-search.io) — all credit to the original creator of the voice model._

This model was used for real-time voice conversion via [rvc_python](https://github.com/RVC-Project/RVC).

## 🕳️ Enter the Machine

    There is no escape. Only interaction.
    Speak — and AM will respond.
